# Pumpkinode

Pumpkinode is a little game, written in Node.js, without third party dependencies, to show how the terminal can be manipulated to make a little game/application (same thing).

The code prioritizes simplicity. If you were to build a real game, you'd want to think more about game state and how it can be modified.

## Misc

I've included a very basic terminal file viewer, too.

Also, I've included some slides which can be viewed using <https://github.com/maaslalani/slides> or just reading the file because it's markdown.
